The front of the house is an oversized covered patio with 3 entrances to the house. The center is the living room, on the left is the small office/bedroom and on the right is the master bedroom.

Here is a view from the driveway side of the house:<br>![](/uploads/outsidedriveway.jpeg){: .lightense-target width="1600" height="1200"}![](/uploads/imagecompressor.zip){: .lightense-target}

Far side of the house features a large flat area with views of the ocean. This is the only side where a neighboring house can be seen:
